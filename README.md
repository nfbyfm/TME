# TME
TME (short for Text-Math-Editor) is a program for writing technical documentations.
Beside the WYSIWYG-document view there's an integrated computer algebra system, which, as of the first release, solves simple algebraic formulas. The results and formulas themselves can be integrated into the document and get updated automatically when exporting or saving  the file as a pdf.
